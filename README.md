# Image-Compression-with-an-Autoencoder-Neural-Network

## Intro
In what acted as a final project for my two semester class on neural networks and deep learning, I created and presented a poster as a part of Colby College's Liberal Arts Symposium. In this project I used Tensorflow's low level API to build and explore the inner workings of how an autoencoder works and how changes in parameters affect the network's outputs. The results of the explorations were then synthesized and displayed for a poster presentation held during the annual CLAS, or Colby Liberal Arts Symposium. This project was undertaken by myself and Austin Perera.
